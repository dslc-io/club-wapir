This is a companion for the book [_Web APIs with R_](https://wapir.io/) by Jon Harmon (in progress, aiming for publication in 2024).

Each chapter title to the left is a link to a slide deck.

-   These slides are being developed *as I write the book.*
    -   They are currently more up-to-date than the book itself.
-   Each deck will open in its own tab.
-   You may want to type "s" at the start of each deck to open the *s*peaker notes. Since these slides are structured like a talk, I tend to make a lot of notes to myself there to expand on the information in the slide.
-   Slides often have a "TODO" section at the start, with notes that I plan to implement on my next pass through the book.
