# How can I better control plumber input and output?

**Learning objectives:**

- THESE ARE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

## SLIDE 1 {-}

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.

## random notes {-}

Include ideas from these [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) articles:

-   [Routing & Input](https://www.rplumber.io/articles/routing-and-input.html)
    -   Specifically input bits. Also Dynammic Routes
-   [Rendering Output](https://www.rplumber.io/articles/rendering-output.html)
