# How can I perform multiple requests?

**Learning objectives:**

- THESE ARE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

## SLIDE 1 {-}

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.

## Random functions to include {-}

-   `req_error()`
-   `req_progress()`
-   `req_cache()`
-   `req_retry()`
-   `req_throttle()`
-   `req_timeout()`
-   `req_options()` todo: figure out what's here and not available via httr2.

## Meeting Videos {-}

### Cohort 1 {-}
