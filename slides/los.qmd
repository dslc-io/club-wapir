# Why learning objectives (LOs)?

## What type of LOs are we focusing on?

-   Readers probably solving semi-specific problems, so...
-   Skill-based learning objectives
    -   "After you read this chapter, you will be able to..."

::: notes
-   Any disagreement with that first bullet?
:::

## Why do they matter?

-   Students learn more when they have clear objectives.
-   Lends structure to my process.
-   Eventually: Lends structure to R4DS

::: notes
-   I like having a process!
-   Aiming to implement these across all of R4DS
-   (Eventually want to also auto-map questions to them)

# Part 1: How can I interact with the web from R?

## Part 1 Learning Objectives Brain Dump

:::: columns

::: column
-   Discover useful APIs
-   Process web data into R-standard formats
-   Fetch data with simple APIs
-   Fetch *lots* of data from APIs
-   Authenticate with APIs
-   Find specific APIs
:::
::: column
-   Do other things (send/update/delete data) with APIs
-   Find R packages that wrap APIs
-   (Use other forms of APIs?)
-   Get web data without APIs ({rvest})
-   Learn more about accessing APIs
:::
::::

::: notes
-   Discover: Just vaguely via apis.guru or similar.
-   Process: This isn't API-specific, but APIs often have deeply nested data
-   Fetch data: No auth. Very basic parsing of the return
-   Fetch lots: Important concept regardless of whether it's "simple"
-   Authenticate: Complicated (see Slack), I want to make it as clear as possible
    -   In part 2 we'll build the complicated thing, I think.
-   Find specific: Shoved this way down the list because it will be hard to have examples that aren't easy. I think I'll replace apis.guru with a true wiki.
-   Do other: `curl_translate()` deep dive here.
-   Find R packages: I want it late so you can tell if it's a bad package
-   Others: gRPC, GraphQL, Websockets
-   rvest: Technically could skip?
-   Learn more: Book recommendations, blogs, etc.
