# Why learning objectives (LOs)?

## What type of LOs are we focusing on?

-   Readers probably solving semi-specific problems, so...
-   Skill-based learning objectives
    -   "After you read this chapter, you will be able to..."

::: notes
-   Any disagreement with that first bullet?
:::

## Why do they matter?

-   Students learn more when they have clear objectives.
-   Lends structure to my process.
-   Eventually: Lends structure to R4DS

::: notes
-   I like having a process!
-   Aiming to implement these across all of R4DS
-   (Eventually want to also auto-map questions to them)

# Part 1: How can I interact with the web from R?

## Part 1 Learning Objectives Brain Dump

-   Discover useful APIs
-   Find specific APIs
-   Fetch data with simple APIs (no auth)
-   Fetch *lots* of data from simple APIs (pagination) 
-   Process fetched data into R-standard formats
-   Authenticate with APIs (tell it who you are)
-   Do other things (send/update/delete data) with APIs
    -   Probably do `curl_translate()` formally here
-   Find R packages that wrap APIs
-   (Use other forms of APIs?)
-   Get web data without APIs ({rvest})
-   Learn more about accessing APIs

# Part 2: How can I create my own APIs with R?

(not filling this out yet)
