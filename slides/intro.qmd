## Prerequisites

-   Very few hard prerequisites
    -   Will point to resources when helpful
-   I assume familiarity with R
    -   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
-   Helpful:
    -   [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) to construct more robust APIs
    -   [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) for deeper dive into üì¶

::: notes
-   How many have read R4DS?
-   How many have read Advanced R?
-   How many have read R Packages?
-   How many have written a function?
-   How many have written a package?
-   Discuss level I can assume.
:::

## What won't I learn?

-   How can I access APIs from other programming languages?
-   How should I design a complex API?
    -   Covered a tiny bit
    -   Many other books, such as [Designing APIs with Swagger and OpenAPI](https://www.manning.com/books/designing-apis-with-swagger-and-openapi)
-   How can I administer an enterprise API?
    -   [DevOps for Data Science](https://do4ds.com/) for tips
    -   Work with professionals for full-scale deployments

::: notes
-   Anything else people would expect?
-   Should I put Adv R here, too?
-   Should I put R Packages here, too?
