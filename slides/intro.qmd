# Who should read this book?

-   Data Analysts
    -   Part 1: Enrich datasets via APIs
-   Machine Learning Engineers
    -   Part 2: Share predictions via APIs
-   Researchers
    -   Part 2: Share data via APIs
-   Shiny App Designers
    -   Part 1: Work with external APIs
    -   Part 2: Divide & conquer

::: notes
-   People who analyze data, not necessarily that job title.
-   Researchers or anybody else with data to share.
-   Does anybody fit into something other than those use cases?
:::

# What will I learn?

-   Part 1: How can I get web data into R? ({httr2})
-   Part 2: How can I create my own APIs with R? ({plumber})
-   Part 3: Use Cases? Recipes?

::: notes
-   Catch-all chapter at end of each section about learning more.
-   Survey: https://forms.gle/9qdYTrDL5cZmG26y6
-   Please fill out the survey, which will get details about which chapters sound interesting to you.
-   Are there any topics there that you *don't* care about?
-   Considering part 3 with things that span chapters (eg, subdividing a Shiny app into APIs). Interesting? Examples?
-   Any missing topics?

## Prerequisites

-   Very few hard prerequisites
    -   Will point to resources when helpful
-   I assume familiarity with R
    -   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
-   Helpful:
    -   [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) to construct more robust APIs
    -   [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) for deeper dive into üì¶

::: notes
-   (I repeat these questions in the survey)
-   How many have read R4DS?
-   How many have read Advanced R?
-   How many have read R Packages?
-   How many have written a function?
-   How many have written a package?
-   How many have published a package on CRAN?
-   Accessed an API from R with httr?
-   Accessed an API from R with httr2?
-   Accessed an API from R some other way?
-   Discuss level I can assume.
:::

## What won't I learn?

-   How can I access APIs with {[httr](https://httr.r-lib.org/)} or {[curl](https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/curl)}?
-   How can I access APIs from other programming languages?
-   How *should* I design a complex API?
    -   Covered a tiny bit
    -   Many other books, such as [Designing APIs with Swagger and OpenAPI](https://www.manning.com/books/designing-apis-with-swagger-and-openapi)
-   How can I administer an enterprise API?
    -   [DevOps for Data Science](https://do4ds.com/) for tips
    -   Work with professionals for full-scale deployments
