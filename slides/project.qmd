## Objectives

-   Convince you that **you care about APIs**
-   Explain why I'm **writing my book "backwards"**
-   Recruit you to **"Cohort 0"** of my book club
-   Give you a **sneak peek** at a **new book club site format**

# Why you care about APIs

## What is an API?

See [How do computers communicate?](httr2/apis.html){target="_blank"}

(chapter 2 of my book)

## Discussion: API Examples

### What do you want to do with APIs?

# "Backwards Design"

[Understanding by Design](https://amzn.to/3GxZ1lw) (Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe, 1998)

1.  ID what learners need to know.
2.  Create an assessment to measure that learning.
3.  Plan the lessons to succeed at assessment.

## My plan

1.  ‚úÖ Rough draft slides
2.  ‚¨ú Discuss material with learners (ID needs)
3.  ‚ùì Create an assessment?
4.  üîÑÔ∏è Revise slides
5.  üìù Write chapter

::: notes
1.  I spent November making rough slides of everything.
2.  Doing this today! (also see next slide)
3.  Not sure about this yet, but may write exercises next
4.  Ideal universe = repeat process, might skip to draft
5.  No solid completion date yet

# Want to learn about WAPIR?

-   Weekly like normal?
-   [r4ds.io/bookclubber/?bookname=Web APIs with R](https://r4ds.io/bookclubber/?bookname=Web%20APIs%20with%20R)

-   To be clear: Book will NOT exist before book club meeting
-   (Highlights might not be up-to-date)

# New Club Site Format

-   Old: [R Packages](https://r4ds.io/rpkgs)
-   New: [This site](https://r4ds.io/wapir)
    -   Lots to do style-wise!
    -   Auto-open decks in new tab?
    -   Numbered chapters?
    -   I'll apply it if things aren't broken

::: notes
-   Need to convince myself that parity is good enough!
-   Refining auto-build and review process.
-   In theory I can copy existing RMDs.
    -   Likely some will fail due to dependencies on one another.
-   Trying to balance reducing confusion vs reducing complexity of rarely edited index.
-   Need to experiment with caching, other build options
    -   Don't want to over-cache and teach outdated code!
