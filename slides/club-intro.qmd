## ️✅ Process

**Meetings = weekly**

-   🧑‍🏫 Jon leads a *discussion* of a chapter
    -   🙋‍♀️ **IMPORTANT:** You ask questions!
    -   ️✅ Goal: 
        -   Cohort 1: Revise/finalize learning objectives
        -   Cohort 2: Do slides get you to the LOs?
        -   Cohort 3+: Read the actual book
    -   📺 Recordings on [DSLC Videos](https://dslc.video)
-   🔄️ Jon revises slides & "test yourself" questions
-   (revisions, maybe future cohorts)
-   📝 Jon writes chapter

::: notes
-   Meet *every* week... unless I need a break to catch up.
-   Discussion even more important than in a normal club
-   Would formal survey of some sort help?
-   Hoping to write as we go, but definitely won't keep up.
