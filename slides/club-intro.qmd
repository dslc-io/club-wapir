## ️✅ Process

**Meetings = weekly**

-   🧑‍🏫 Jon leads a *discussion* of a chapter
    -   🙋‍♀️ **IMPORTANT:** You ask questions!
    -   ️✅ Goal: Revise/finalize learning objectives
    -   📺 Recordings on [R4DS YouTube](https://r4ds.io/youtube)
-   🔄️ Jon revises slides
-   ❓Jon writes "test yourself" questions
    -   🧵 Discuss in channel?
-   (revisions, maybe future cohorts)
-   📝 Jon writes chapter

::: notes
-   Meet *every* week... unless I need a break to catch up.
-   Review revised slides? Maybe spend 2 weeks per chapter?
-   Would formal survey of some sort help?
-   Not 100% certain about question structure yet (whether "homeworky" or "think about it").
-   Hoping to write as we go, but definitely won't keep up.
