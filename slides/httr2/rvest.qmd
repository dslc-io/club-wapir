## Should I scrape this data? {-}

## Can I legally scrape this data? {-}

-   Personal use or nonprofit education = usually ok
-   Be careful about personally identifiable information (PII)
-   Check legal disclaimers (but may be over-protective)
-   US:
    -   Can't copyright facts,
    -   *CAN* copyright collections of facts in some cases (creative)
-   Other places:
    -   Sometimes stricter ([EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996L0009:EN:HTML))
    -   Sometimes more lax

## Should I scrape this data? {-}

`robots.txt`

-   User-agent: * = everybody
-   Search for name(s) of package(s) 
-   Search for specific pages
-   Check root of site (`/`) and your particular subfolder 
-   These aren't (necessarily) legally binding

## Do I need to scrape this data? {-}

-   Try {[datapasta](https://cran.r-project.org/package=datapasta)} üì¶
    -   RStudio Addins
-   If it's one time & over-complicated, consider other copy/paste strategies
-   Only scrape what you need
-   Look for an API!

## How can I scrape tables of data? {-}

## Example 1: Single table {-}

(screenshot of table on page)

## How can I scrape a single table? {-}

(code demo of scraping a table)

## Example 2: Multiple tables {-}

(screenshot of tables on page)

## How can I choose a table? {-}

(code demo of scraping one of many tables)

## How can I scrape multiple tables? {-}

(purrr)

## How can I scrape more complex data? {-}

## What is SelectorGadget? {-}

-   ADD CONTENTS

## Example 3: Non-tabular data {-}

(screenshot of page with non-tabular data, possibly CSS selector rules)

## How can I use SelectorGadget? {-}

(record clicks? also show code where it goes)

## What are CSS selectors? {-}

-   (I continue to go back and forth about Xpath vs CSS Selectors. Xpath can traverse back up the tree, which I feel might be vital for some advanced examples; but then again maybe CSS `:has()` will be enough)
