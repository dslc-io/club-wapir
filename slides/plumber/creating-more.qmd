# How can I learn more about creating APIs?

**Learning objectives:**

- THESE ARE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

## SLIDE 1 {-}

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.

## Notes {-}

-   Link to lambdr site.
-   Mention Shiny options for POST, etc?
-   Almost definitely link to OpenAPI book
-   Maybe discuss a little bit about digging through (plumber) code to learn

## Meeting Videos {-}

### Cohort 1 {-}
